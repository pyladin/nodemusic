# NodeMusic
> A set of client and server scripts that start, and monitor, an ffmpeg/ffplay
stream.

Recently we were required to broadcast a single audio source to a number of
endpoints in a modular fashion with easy administration. NodeMusic was written
to help simplify that project and allow endpoints to easily connect and get
their instructions.
